guard (move and catch), camera (just watch), drone (watch and move)
max: make sure to be connected to real data, frontend, select map point
oleh: agents creation, behavior, movement, interaction, graph implementation


Plan:
1. Examine the border, choose the most used area for crossing
2. Model the behaviour of the agents (different policemen + migrant)
3.



Migrant = {
  armed: bool,
  speed: float,
  sex: bool,
  ?? spawn-point: tuple,
  ?? location: tuple,
  caught: bool,
  crossed_border: bool
}

Officer = {
  static: bool,
  range: float,
  transport: [Car, Helicopter, Feet],
  speed: transport.speed
  ?? home_watchtower: Watchtower
}

Watchtower = {
  location: tuple,
  police_capacity: int,
  police_count: int,
  range: float,
}

Transport = {
  speed: float,
  terain: list,
  police_capacity: int,
}

Car(Transport) = {}
Helicopter(Transport) = {}
Feet(Transport) = {}

Terrain = {
  speed_constraint: float * agent.speed
}

River(Terrain) = {}
Swamp(Terrain) = {}
Road(Terrain) = {}
Trail(Terrain) = {}
Field(Terrain) = {}
Forest(Terrain) = {}
Wall(Terrain) = {}
